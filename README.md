## My findings
- 
- PCA or Principal Component Analysis is a method to reduce the initial dataset size to a smaller one with fewer independent variables/attributes, and mostly applied in classification problems. For regression, we have PCR or Principal Component Regression.
- Each principal component is a linear combination of the original variables:
```
PC = w1X1 + w1X2 + ... + wnXn
where X is the original variable and w is weight/coefficient 
```
